## Description of data
### Lalonde
The Lalonde dataset is a publicly available dataset that is used to evaluate the causal effects of training programs on earnings. The dataset was collected from the National Supported Work Demonstration (NSWD), which was a large-scale social experiment conducted in the United States in the late 1970s. The NSWD randomly assigned participants to either a treatment group, which received a two-year job training and support program, or a control group, which did not receive any special treatment. [1]

The Lalonde dataset contains data on 445 participants in the NSWD, including 185 treated participants and 260 control participants. The dataset includes 10 variables.
The Lalonde dataset is a valuable resource for researchers who are interested in evaluating the causal effects of social programs. The dataset has been used in numerous studies to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs, welfare-to-work programs, and other social interventions.

The Lalonde dataset is available for download from the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). [2]

### IHDP
The IHDP dataset is a dataset that is used to evaluate the effects of home visits on the cognitive development of premature infants. The dataset comes from a randomized experiment that was conducted in the United States from 1985 to 1988. In the experiment, 985 premature infants were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which received home visits from specialists, or a control group, which did not receive home visits.

The IHDP dataset contains data on 985 infants, including 492 treated infants and 493 control infants. The dataset contains 29 variables.
The IHDP dataset is an important resource for researchers who are interested in the effects of early intervention programs on the cognitive development of children. The dataset has been used in numerous studies to evaluate the effects of home visits, early education programs, and other interventions.

The IHDP dataset is available for download from the website of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). [3]
